# Recommender

Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are two kinds of recommender systems that provide users with information to help them find and choose anything from books, to movies, to restaurants, to courses based on their own preferences compared to the preferences of others. Recommender tests different algorithms for recommending items based on the responses made by others. Practices include reading data from files, using Python dictionaries and lists, and sorting data to find good matches. 

Included in this repo: 
1. RecommenderEngine.py -- this module is the basis for making recommendations from data related to ratings of individual items by raters/users. It is used to make recommendations in different areas: movies, books, food, and courses.
2. TestRecommender.py -- this module can use SmallDukeEatsReader.py. 
3. X-Reader.py modules -- these modules read data files in different formats and return a list of items and a dictionary of ratings corresponding to these items in the format outlined below. This includes MovieReader.py and BookReader.py.
4. RecommenderMaker.py -- makes recommendations for movies or books or courses or eateries.
