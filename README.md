# Recommender

Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are two kinds of recommender systems that provide users with information to help them find and choose anything from books, to movies, to restaurants, to courses based on their own preferences compared to the preferences of others. Recommender tests different algorithms for recommending items based on the responses made by others. Practices include reading data from files, using Python dictionaries and lists, and sorting data to find good matches.
